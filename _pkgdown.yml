  - title: Cohort definitions
    desc:  >
      Cohorts are time series-orientated sets of patient records:
      selected for their shared characteristics (eg. all strokes
      admitted within a given time period).
      Cohort definitions are objects in R to describe the rules to
      form a cohort of patient in R, and provide metadata about the
      cohort (such as the cohort name, a description of how that
      cohort was selected, etc).

  - title: Audit measures
    desc:  >
      Audit measures are measures of quality that will be performed
      upon each record within the cohort. They can either be discrete
      (ie. the record met or did not meet criteria), or continuous
      (ie. a measure of time or some other continuous variable).
      These are represented as individual audit_measure objects,
      which define the measure and provide metadata about it (such
      as a name, and descriptor of what is being measured and why).

  - title: Audit output specifications
    desc: >
      A series of audit measures must be applied to a cohort to
      produce aggregated and anonymised results for analysis. We
      define a table of audit measures together as a group called an
      audit output specification. The way to do this is to create a
      tibble with pre-defined columns describing which measures
      should be applied together: the primary column of which contains
      each individual audit measure. as_audit_output_spec describes
      the other columns needed in this tibble.
    contents:
      - as_audit_output_spec
      - is_audit_output_spec

  - title: Cohort data definitions
    desc: >
      Once a cohort has been defined, and an audit output
      specification describing the summary values of audit measures
      has been defined, these need to be put together to make a
      cohort_data_definition object. This is what will be passed to
      create_cohort to then produce a cohort of data with the summary
      statistics requested.

    - cohort_data_definition
    - is_cohort_data_definition

  - title: Creating a cohort
    desc: >
      There are two useful outputs that can be created from the data.
      Record-level output can be created using create_filtered_cohort,
      which takes a cohort data definition and applies additional
      filtering to it. This is primarily for us in realtime
      dashboards or internal team reporting where knowing patient
      detail is required. create_aggregated_cohort returns summarised
      aggregated and anonymised data about each patient and is used
      for external-facing reports.

  - title: SSNAP measure, audit output and cohort definitions
    desc:  >
      SSNAPStats works by building a library of calculations to
      apply to cohorts of stroke patient data - both at record
      (individual patients) level and for aggregation (summary
      statistics of patients grouped by time period or treating team).
      These are mainly applied by the cohorts function to make our
      cohorts, but they are exposed for use by other packages if
      required. Fields are created at record level; measures are
      aggregations of sets of records.
      For information governance purposes we want data to be handled
      in aggregated form only wherever possible unless it's essential
      to expose individual patient detail.

  - title: SSNAP summary statistics definitions
    desc: >
      Summary statistics definitions are sets of calculations applied
      alongside the audit output specification to perform calculations
      upon the aggregated data. Summary statistics have to refer to
      the names of the generated rows (eg. a median as ColumnNameQ2.)
      Common applications are for creating therapy compliance
      calculations from other domain results for the therapy domains;
      or calculating the SSNAP scores for each domain or key
      indicator.

  - title: SSNAP report periods
    desc:  >
      SSNAP reporting periods were initially quarterly, following the
      financial year. For the 2016 and 2017 financial years, reports
      have been trimesterly (4-monthly). From April 2018,
      three-monthly has returned. This makes working out the report
      period from the date and vice versa complicated. These functions
      assist with that, and are used by SSNAPStats, SSNAPReports and
      SSNAPDashboard.

    desc:  >
      These are functions at the end of their lifecycle, and are in
      the process of being removed or replaced. This may be because
      a better method has been found; or it might be because it is
      no longer needed or is better located elsewhere within our
      package suite; but work is ongoing to remove all dependency on
      the code. The documentation should be clear what the intended
      development direction with the function is. Once we are happy
      all dependency on the code is removed it and its documentation
      are removed.
