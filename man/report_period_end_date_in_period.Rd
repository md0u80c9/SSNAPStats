\description{
\code{report_period_end_date_in_period} takes a SSNAP reporting
period number and returns the end date of that period.
}
\details{
SSNAP has gone from a period of quarterly to trimesterly reports
(and back again). So we can't use conventional quarterly reporting
as we have trimesterly reporting for two financial years.

The report_period functions act as conversions between dates and
the reporting periods.
